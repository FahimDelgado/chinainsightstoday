Pod vapes are pocket-friendly, easy to use and cheaper than traditional cigarettes, so many smokers are looking for pod vapes with which they can relax whenever and wherever they want. But with so many different products and brands available on the market, finding the best vape that is suitable for you can be difficult. 

If you are one of the smokers who are on the hunt for a device that can offer a top-notch smoking satisfaction, here is a list of the 5 best pod vapes of 2018


##### Juul Starter Kit

Dubbed the “Apple of vaping”, Juul has captured a large amount of market share. As one of its series, The Juul Starter Kit has become a favorite among E-cig starters. 

The Juul Starter Kit four flavors: Mango Nectar, Royal Creme, Golden Tobacco and Glacier Mint in 5% nicotine strength. This small vape pen is designed in the simplest way, without any buttons or switches, which makes it very easy to use. 

In terms of battery, The Juul Starter Kit takes only 45-60 minutes to fully charge, and you are likely to charge it once a day. If you want to check the battery life, you can simply double tap the small LED that can indicate the battery life with flashing colors: green for a high level, yellow for a medium level, and red for running out of power.

In addition, the Juul Starter Kit uses temperature control, which avoids producing smoke that is too hot for your mouth. And with the company’s patented JuulSalts approach to nicotine delivery, it is able to provide a nicotine hit that’s really similar to smoking a cigarette.

##### MyBlu Starter Kit

The MyBlu is a new pod vape and it goes for easy flavor changes and hassle-free. It is sturdy, lightweight and slightly larger than a JUUL. It also looks like a USB flash drive, so it’s still small enough and easy to hold, allowing vapor satisfaction in a compact design.

It comes with a user manual, a micro USB charger, a 350 mAh battery that charges quickly and a Gold Leaf 1.5 milliliter liquid pod. The Gold Leaf Tobacco is impressive. If you are not a fan of tobacco flavors, you might want to try this one because the inhale is sweet. The throat hit is great, and the exhale is also creamy like tobacco.

When it comes to flavors, the new MyBlu has been improved over the old version. These new pods use a new e-liquid solution to make the throat hit more substantial. The airflow is tight and restricted, which allows a mouth to lung satisfaction like a real traditional cigarette. In addition, its 1-click liquid pods let you switch flavors just in seconds.

##### DOT Vape Kit

The DOT Vape Kit has a compact and stylish design. It’s really a lightweight device, but it seems quite durable. 

One of the great features is that there are no buttons on the device because it is activated by drawing on the mouth piece. The tiny light on the body will be on while you are inhaling. Pod-switching is very easy too. They can just slide into the top of the battery and are held in place by the strong magnetic connection. Therefore, if you are looking for a really easy-to-use vape device, the DOT Vape Kit is definitely the best option. 

The best part is the latest technology that this device is using. The DOT Vape Kit features the new [FEELM](http://www.feelmtech.com/) technology. This [new vaping technology](http://www.feelmtech.com/), which has won the Golden Leaf Award in the Most Exciting Newcomer of the Industry Category, features a special ceramic cube with an integrated flat metal film, ensuring instant vapor production and true flavor. The FEELM technology is able to completely vaporizes every drop of E-liquid, resulting in richer vapor and smoother throat hit and providing a satisfying vape.

Instead of using nicotine traditionally found in E-liquids, the pods contain nicotine salt, which creates a smoother vape for the higher strength of e-liquid in DOT. These Pods come in 20mg/ml strength and has 4 flavors: menthol, tobacco, strawberry, and berry.

##### VUSE Alto Kit

The VUSE Alto kit comes with four pod flavors: Original, Rich Tobacco, Menthol, and Mixed Berry. As it combines stealth, ease of use, and great flavors like its predecessors the Vuse Vibe and Vuse Ciro, The VUSE Alto is definitely one of the favorites among vape lovers.  

The mouthpiece is well designed to offer a comfortable, smooth and quiet draw. It actually has a bigger battery than a Juul and also the pods have more juice in them. There is a green light that will illuminate when the device is producing vapor. At the bottom is a cool magnetic charger which allows you to vape even while charging. The pods with 1.8 mL capacity have 5% nicotine, which is identical to the Juul. 

Not only are the battery and the pods bigger, but also there is something about them that allows long-lasting hits. With some other vaping devices, you vape a few times and you are not getting as much as vapor. But you can vape your VUSE Alto one vape after another and the hit is not getting dry. In addition, the VUSE Alto really has a decent cloud compared to other devices on the market.
