*Perhaps you have seen the E-clipse dried out herb vaporizer?*

Dry out herb vaporizers are continuing to gain popularity for his or her design and simplicity. They provide users and possibility to burn herbs in contained chambers and inhale the vapor.

My spouse and i was sent the E-clipse kit, which include everything you need to begin with in dry out herb vaping, with the exception of the herb. The system includes these devices, replacement O-rings, a cleaning brush, a scraping device, a USB charger and two distinct mouthpieces.

The E-clipse is convenient because the electric battery is built in and charges through the USB. A significant bonus is that is keeps a charger for days. As a individual I must admit that I hate needing to repeatedly charge my gadgets. Having the one which chargers quickly (in a few short hours) and holds a fee for days is a major hit in my book.

The 2200mah lithium polymer battery totally switches into the Pro column in my book.

## Performance

Now, let's speak about the ceramic heating chamber.

Ceramic is awesome since it allows for clean flavor. The chamber is normally 5/8 in . deep and keeps a decent amount dry herb, which is fine. Some other dry herb vaporizers may offer deeper chambers but it's all about how precisely much an individual needs.

With regards to by using a dry herb vaporizer, I use mine a couple of times a day, throughout the week. The ceramic chamber on the E-clipse is certainly a pretty magnificent size for my necessities. Having an included scrapping and packing application is also a plus. All of the tools needed are included, can't beat that.

The E-clipse fits nicely into the palm of the hand and disappears, which is ideal for any user desiring to be discreet.

As most vape units, the E-clipse turns on with five clicks of the fire button and turns off the same manner. Other than the fire button, the just other buttons are along, which sets heat of the ceramic chamber.

The E-clipse could be set from 300 to 435 degrees, which is a nice range because, based on what herb or combination of herbs you are wanting to use, you might have a variety of numerous temperatures. The E-clipse heats up quickly which means you don't have to prime and wait, which is awesome, specifically if you are employing in on less temperature. A very important factor no vaper wants to do is usually await their device to get ready. Heck, almost all of us don't even like to hold out a few lousy minutes for a fresh coil to prime effectively.

If you are not used to dry herb vaporizers, do a little research to learn what temperature to shed your desired herb at. Also, some herbs must be ground before putting them in the E-clipse, so to be able not to burn or waste your dried out herb, take a look before you turn up the E-clipse.

In case you are wondering what herbs you need to use in the E-clipse, you may be surprised to know that there are a sizable selection of totally-legal-in-every-state options. Not long ago i used a blend of damiana, peppermint and lemon balm that's reported to be calming. I enjoyed it, nonetheless it took some used to the flavour. Of course, you might head to a place where pot dispensaries happen to be legal (such as for example NEVADA) and get the nice stuff if you so choose.

## Ease of use

Okay, now we need to talk about the one major thing about the E-clipse dry herb vaporizer that I'd devote the con category found in superb, big capital letters.

The gosh darn thing will not stand up alone. Man, is that amazingly frustrating!

As a user, and other vapers I know agree, you pick up the vape have a hit or two and then set it back off. Well not with the E-clipse. You must lay the E-clipse down because it includes a rounded bottom.

I cannot tell you how many moments I've dropped the dang matter, when I go to set it down away of mere habit.

On that be aware I must say that the E-clipse does appear to be very durable, because given the number of circumstances it's fallen off the cabinet, it really is still running like a champ.

Now let's talk selling price. The E-clipse markets for around $150 according to the merchant. For a normal vape mod, as a user, I'd say that $150 is well above the purchase price that I'm willing to pay. But the E-clipse can be an all-in-one and doesn't need you to buy additional tanks, coils or cotton. You don't want an exterior charger or not the dry herb to take pleasure from the E-clipse.

## Conclusion

So, let's execute a recap. The E-clipse has a decent sized ceramic heating chamber that is relatively simple to keep tidy and reuse. It suits nicely into the side and take and conceals easily if this is the want of the user.

It's dummy-proof found in its use, with a fairly easy on, easy off and convenient temperature setting. It also circumstances itself off when you end using it, which is handy. It charges very well and holds that charge for a long time.
